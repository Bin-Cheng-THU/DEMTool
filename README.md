# DEMBody

The software focus on investigation of geological features, surface evolution and in-situ exploration on celestrial bodies, e.g., size sorting/segregation on asteroid, mass creep/wasting during geological processes and locomotion dynamics of asteroid lander on granular layer.

The software implements the Discrete Element Method (DEM), coupled with NBody gravity simulation. DEMBody is designed for execution on parallel supercomputers, clusters or multi-core PCs running a Linux (or Windows)-based operating system.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project for development and testing purposes.

### Structure
  `Data`: storage for data file including point data, wall data and biDisperse data.
  
  `src`: source code of DEMBody.
  
  `Input`: input files including systemControl.dembody, input_points.txt, bondedWallPoint.vtk, trimeshWall.mesh, bondedTriMeshWall.mesh, largeParticles.bidisperse, gravTriMesh.force.

### Pre-/Post-process

We developed [DEMTool](https://github.com/Bin-Cheng-THU/DEMTool.git) for pre- and post- process for DEMBody, e.g., point/mesh file generation and data rending based on [POV-Ray](http://www.povray.org/).
